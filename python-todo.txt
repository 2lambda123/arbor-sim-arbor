Work left to do in Python wrapper, in no particular order of priority:

- defining connections to build networks
recipe stuff
    * querying the number of targets (for events)
    * querying the number of sources (of spikes)
* plotting/viewing/printing sampler outputs
* event_generator wrapper
* expose more of model querying interface
* simple C functions for making example cells
* setting probes and samplers
* LIF cell
* ring network example
* all to all network example
* GPU support
* MPI support

* wrapper for cable cell definitions

cells:
    * wrap arb::cell
    * three functions that mak basic cells with no synapses or stimuli
        *. soma only single compartment
        2. ball and stick
        3. ball and 3 stick
    * function for adding stimulus
    * function for adding synapses
    * function for adding detector

ring recipe
    - hh single compartment cells in a ring of n cells
    - brief stimulus on cell 1
     *
     * Stimuli:
     *    soma centre, t=[10 ms, 110 ms), 0.1 nA


event generators:
    - event generator trampoline
    - wrap available event generators
        - poisson
        - regular
        - one that takes a Python list

probe support
