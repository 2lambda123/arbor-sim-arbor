- rename `multi_event_stream` and simplify unit tests
- hoist time state information from `shared_state` completely.
- exact sampling, for which there are two approaches:
    - remove it completely
    - if enabled, force step size to next time point in stream.
    - rip out the sampling types and just record sampled values at every step, then post-process during sample callbacks.
- GPU implementations
