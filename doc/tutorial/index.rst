Quick start
================================

.. Note::
    You can find some examples of full Arbor simulations in the ``python/examples`` directory of the `Arbor repository <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>`_.
    Note that some examples use ``pandas`` and ``seaborn`` for analysis and plotting which are expected to be installed independently from Arbor.
