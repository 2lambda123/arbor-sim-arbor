Python
======

Arbor provides a full set of python bindings that expose all functionality.

The bindings can be used to develop Python-based simulators to integrate Arbor as a backend,
or for more adventurous modelers to build models directly.


Say G'day
---------

Every API should be able to say hello, because manners.
Pyarb has the manners, but it is a bit shy, so you have to prompt it to say hello.


.. container:: example-code

   .. code-block:: python

        import pyarb as arb

        arb.hello_world()

Which makes the following output...

.. code-block:: none

    hello world from Pyarb!
