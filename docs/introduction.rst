Why Arbor?
##########

Ccomputational neuroscience relies heavily in computer simulations to achieve scientific outcomes.
In the push from petascale to exascale computing, a diverse ecosystem of computational platforms is emerging, include GPUs and vectorized multi-core processors.

These new computing architectures promise exciting opportunities for larger, more detailed simulations run over longer time periods.
However, developing software that runs efficiently accross all systems is becoming harder and harder.

Arbor is a library developed by the HPC community to help computational neuroscientists take advantage of such systems.
