# Remote Communication with External Simulators

This example shows
1. setting up a simulation that uses an external tool to source spikes.
2. the in-band control and spike exchange protocols. 
3. use of the supplemental tools exposed by Arbor to handle these connections.

Please run it with at least two MPI processes.
