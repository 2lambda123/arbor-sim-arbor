- hoist time state information from `shared_state` completely.
- exact sampling, for which there are two approaches:
    - remove it completely
    - if enabled, force step size to next time point in stream.
    - rip out the sampling types and just record sampled values at every step, then post-process during sample callbacks.
- GPU implementation
- update docs for
    - event binning
    - sampling
- add inline docs to `fvm_lowered_cell_impl` that explain login behind pse and sampling event marking and delivery.
