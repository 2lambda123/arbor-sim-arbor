# Ornstein-Uhlenbeck input to LIF neuron

This example is taken from [Jannik Luboeinski's repo](https://github.com/jlubo/arbor_ou_lif_example)
and adapted for inclusion into Arbor.

The simulation consists of a single compartment cell with simple leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
dynamics with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) input current.  The OU input current can approximate the
synaptic input from a population of neurons.  This is mathematically based on the diffusion
approximation, which analytically describes the input current that arises from presynaptic Poisson
spiking if the spiking activity is sufficiently high and the evoked postsynaptic potentials are
sufficiently small compared to the threshold potential [1,2].  Moreover, the exponentially decaying
autocorrelation function of the OU process resembles that of currents evoked by the spiking activity
of many neocortical neurons [3].
