## The Arbor Code of Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or any other characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly provoking aliases or nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

## Concerns

If you believe one of these standards has been violated, you can either file an issue on an appropriate repository, reach out to the [Arbor project by email](mailto:arbor-sim@fz-juelich.de) or confidentially contact someone outside of the Arbor team, see below. Keep in mind that most mistakes are due to ignorance rather than malice.

Arbor is an Ebrains/HBP project. Its policies and recourse options in case of concern are therefore available to to you. In addition, the European Commission recognizes the ALLEA Code of Conduct as a model for all research it funds, which includes Ebrains/HBP/Arbor.
