=========

.. Note::
    You can find some examples of full Arbor simulations in the ``python/examples`` directory of the
    `Arbor repository <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>`_. Note that some examples use ``pandas``
     and ``seaborn`` for analysis and plotting which are expected to be installed independently from Arbor.

.. Todo::
    Add more in-depth tutorial-like pages building up examples here.
