## The Arbor Code of Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or any other characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly provoking aliases or nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

## Concerns

If you believe one of these standards has been violated, you can reach out to the Arbor project by email, [concern@arbor-simulator.org](mailto:concern@arbor-simulator.org). Nora Abi Akar, Sam Yates and Brent Huisman read this inbox and will get back to you in a timely manner. Your complaint and the private information therein will be handled with the utmost care and confidentiality. Alternatively, you can contact someone outside of the Arbor team at Ebrains, [see below](#ebrains).

In general, violations of the community standards will generate one or more of the following responses from the Arbor Team:

1. Informal feedback, privately and/or (for public violations) in the forum where a violation appeared, with the goal of encouraging good-faith contributions and mutual understanding while making offenders aware of the problem and preventing future incidents. Where possible, good intentions of the participants should be assumed.
2. Gross online violations of community standards may result in immediate deletion of the offending comments, coupled with informal feedback.
3. For severe cases, especially persistent, disruptive violations despite repeated warnings and other feedback, a formal investigation may be started through the Ebrains Ombudsperson.

## Ebrains

Arbor is an Ebrains/HBP project. Its policies and recourse options in case of concern are therefore available to you. In addition, the European Commission recognizes the ALLEA Code of Conduct as a model for all research it funds, which includes Ebrains/HBP/Arbor.
