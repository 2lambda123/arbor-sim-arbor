Welcome to the documentation for Arbor, the multi-compartment neural network simulation library.

:ref:`Get Arbor<in_install>`, :ref:`get started<gs_other_examples>` or read on!

What's Arbor?
-------------

Arbor is a high-performance library for computational neuroscience simulations with multi-compartment, morphologically-detailed cells,
from single cell models to very large networks. Arbor is written from the ground up with many-cpu and gpu architectures in mind, to
help neuroscientists effectively use contemporary and future HPC systems to meet their simulation needs.

Arbor supports NVIDIA and AMD GPUs as well as explicit vectorization on CPUs from Intel (AVX, AVX2 and AVX512) and ARM (Neon and SVE).
When coupled with low memory overheads, this makes Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable simulation software.

Arbor is open source and openly developed, and we use development practices such as unit testing, continuous integration, and validation.

Documentation organisation
--------------------------

* :ref:`gs_other_examples` contains a few ready-made examples you can use to quickly get started using Arbor. In the tutorial descriptions we link to the relevant Arbor concepts.
* :ref:`modelintro` describes the design and concepts used in Arbor. The breakdown of concepts is mirrored (as much as possible) in the :ref:`pyoverview` and :ref:`cppoverview`, so you can easily switch between languages and concepts.
* :ref:`hpcoverview` details Arbor-features for distribution of computation over supercomputer nodes.
* :ref:`intoverview` describes Arbor code that is not user-facing; convenience classes, architecture abstractions, etc.
