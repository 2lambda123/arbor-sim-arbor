Modelling
=========

Arbor is a new project, and our first serious users are getting their hands dirty writing the first non-toy models. With time, best practices, tips and tricks and a collection of howtos for common features should become apparent, and will then be shown here.

In the meantime, we encouraged the use of our Github Discussions board for public discussions on modelling: `Github Discussions <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/discussions>`_.

Under the `arbor-contrib <https://github.com/arbor-contrib/>`_ organisation, some users have already shared their models. You can peruse these at your leisure, and of course add yours if you like to share! `Please contact us <https://docs.arbor-sim.org/en/stable/contrib/index.html#get-in-touch>`_ to have your model added to our list.
