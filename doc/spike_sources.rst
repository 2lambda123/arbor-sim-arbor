Spike Source Cells
============

This page gives an overview of available spike sources. These are artificial cell.
The spikes generated from these cells are typically not generated by neuroscientific model.
The spikes generated will be distributed and can be recorded as normal spikes. 

The following standard operations are NOT possible:
 - Connect samplers.
 - Create synapses and thus connections from other cells.


Types:
------
Regular Spiking Source:
    Emits spikes with regular intervals.

       rss_cell
   
Data Spike Source:
    Emits spikes on configured times

       :maxdepth: 1
       
       dss_cell

Inhomogeneous Poisson Spike Source
    Emits Poisson distributed spikes trains with an time variable rate depending on 
    a function described in the configuration
