Writing documentation
=====================

The source for `the documentation <https://arbor.readthedocs.io>`__ is
found in the ``/doc`` subdirectory, C++ examples in ``/example`` and
Python examples in ``/python/example``. You can add yours in the same
way you would contribute code, please see the “Github workflow” section.

    Very much in progress.

Labels
------

We try to cross-link where we can, which means we label where we can. To help manage the many labels this results in,
we try to create labels following the `filename-sectionname` pattern.

Language
--------

Although the primary language of Arbor is C++, we use English for most of the non-code.
If you need some help writing clear English, you can consult the European Unions `English style guide <https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf>`_.
