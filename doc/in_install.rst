Install Arbor
#############################

Currently we offer three ways to get Arbor.

1. **Python Package**. To get started quickly with Arbor using its Python API on your personal machine, see the :ref:`Python installation guide <in_python>`.
2. **Build and install from source**. To build and install Arbor, on your own machine or HPC environment, see :ref:`in_build_install`.

If you wish to use the C++ API, you'll need to build Arbor from source or using Spack. Note that you can also build the Python bindings using these methods.
