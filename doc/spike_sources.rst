Spike Source Cells
============

This page gives an overview of available spike sources. These are artificial cell.
The spikes generated from these cells are typically not generated by neuroscientific model.
The spikes generated will be distributed and can be recorded as normal spikes. 

The following standard operations are NOT possible:
 - Connect samplers.
 - Create synapses and thus connections from other cells.


Types:
------
Regular Spiking Source:
    This cell emits spikes on regular intervals.
