# BluePyOpt layer-5 pyramidal cell output

This example was created in an environment with the `bluepyopt` package installed, running

```shell
python /path/to/BluePyOpt/examples/l5pc/generate_acc.py -o <output-dir>
```

We use the Arbor BBP mechanism catalogue as a substitute for the one in BluePyOpt and an Arbor simulation can be launched using

```shell
python ../../single_cell_bpo_l5pc_detailed_recipe.py l5pc.json
```
