This section describes some of the core concepts of Arbor including cell definitions and interactions.

Cells
=====

The basic unit of abstraction in an Arbor model is a cell.
A cell represents the smallest model that can be simulated.
Cells interact with each other via spike exchange and gap junctions.
Cells can be of various types, admitting different representations and implementations.
A *cell group* represents a collection of cells of the same type together with an implementation of their simulation.
Arbor currently supports specialized leaky integrate and fire cells and cells representing artificial spike sources in
addition to multi-compartment neurons.

                                                      and identifying an item within a cell-local collection by the
                                                      member `index`.
    ========================  ======================  ===========================================================


Each cell has a global identifier :cpp:type:`gid` associated to it. The :cpp:type:`gid` is used by the :ref:`recipe <modelrecipe>`
to build the global network. Cells may interact with other cells via :ref:`connections <modelconnections>` or
:ref:`gap junctions <modelgapjunctions>`. These interactions happen at specific positions on the cell which can
be one of three types:

1. **Source**: A spike source associated to a *connection*. It detects spikes; if part of a connection, it sends the spikes to **targets**.
2. **Target**: A synapse associated to a *connection*. It has an associated synaptic mechanism that can respond to spikes from **sources**.
3. **Gap Junction Site**: A site associated to a *gap junction*. It represents one half of the gap junction.

Each of these positions is located on a specific point on a cell. It has an :cpp:type:`index` relative to all other positions of
the same type on that cell. That cell, as previously mentioned, has a :cpp:type:`gid` to index it relative to other cells in the simulation.
The (:cpp:type:`gid`, :cpp:type:`index`) pairs make up the :cpp:type:`cell_member` type used to index **sources**, **targets** and **gap junctions sites**
for all cells in a simulation.

    ========================  ======================  ===========================================================

1. **Cable**

   Cable cells are morphologically detailed cells represented as branching linear 1D segments. Cable cells can be coupled
   to other cell types via spike exchange, e.g. a cable cell can receive spikes from a *spiking* cell, and spikes
   form a cable cell can be sent to an *LIF* cell. Cable cells are coupled to other cells by two different mechanisms:

   1. Spike exchange over a **connection** with fixed latency.
   2. Direct electrical coupling between two cable cells via **gap junctions**.

   Key concepts:

   * **Morphology**: The morphology of a cable cell is built from the soma outwards; a child branch cannot be constructed before its parent.
     density mechanisms can be added to already constructed cables.
   * **Detectors**: These refer to the **sources** of :ref:`connections <modelconnections>`.
     They are declared by specifying a location on a branch of the cell, and a threshold voltage for spike detection.
     They have a local index (:cpp:type:`cell_member::index`) relative to other detectors on the cell.
   * **Synapses**: These refer to the **targets** of :ref:`connections <modelconnections>`.
     They are declared by specifying a location on a branch of the cell, and a synapse (point) mechanism.
     They have a local index (:cpp:type:`cell_member::index`) relative to other synapses on the cell.
   * **Gap Junction Sites**: These refer to the sites of :ref:`gap junctions <modelgapjunctions>`.
     They are declared by specifying a location on a branch of the cell.
     They have a local index (:cpp:type:`cell_member::index`) relative to other **gap junction sites** on the cell.

2. **LIF**

   Leaky integrate and fire neuron. It is a point neuron with one built-in **source** and one built-in **target**.
   It does not support adding additional **sources** or **targets**. It does not support gap junctions.

3. **Spiking**

   Spike source from values inserted via a `schedule description`. It is a point neuron with one built-in **source** and no **targets**.
   It does not support adding additional **sources** or **targets**. It does not support gap junctions.

4. **Benchmark**

   Proxy cell used for benchmarking. Similarly to a spiking cell, a benchmark cell generates spikes according to values
   inserted via a `schedule description`. It also accepts a `realtime ratio` parameter that represents the ratio of
   real cell advancement time to simulation time (if equal to 1, then a single cell can be advanced in realtime).
   A benchmark cell has one built-in **source** and one built-in **target**.
   It does not support adding additional **sources** or **targets**. It does not support gap junctions.

.. _modelconnections:

Connections
===========

Connections represent one of the two types of cell interactions supported in Arbor (the other being :ref:`gap junctions <modelgapjunctions>`).
They implement chemical synapses between **source** and **target** cells and are characterized by having a transmission delay.

Connections in Arbor are defined in two steps:

1. **Source** and **Target** instantiation on the cells: A connection is formed between two locations on two cells.
   These locations need to be declared on the :ref:`cell <modelcells>`.
2. Connection instantiation in the :ref:`recipe <modelrecipe>`: The **sources** and **targets** are indexed using :cpp:type:`cell_member`,
   which identifies a specific instance (:cpp:type:`cell_member::index`) on a specific cell (:cpp:type:`cell_member::gid`). A connection is
   instantiated by providing the **source** :cpp:type:`cell_member` and the **target** :cpp:type:`cell_member`, as well as a weight.
   In the recipe, each cell has access to all of the connections whose **targets** are on that cell.

.. _modelgapjunctions:

Gap Junctions
=============

Gap Junctions represent one of the two types of cell interactions supported in Arbor (the other being :ref:`modelconnections`).
They implement electrical synapses where transmission between cells is bidirectional and faster than chemical synapses though with lower gain.
They are modeled as a conductance between two **gap junction sites** on two cells.

Similarly to `Connections`, Gap Junctions in Arbor are defined in two steps:

1. **Gap junction site** instantiation on the cells: A gap junction is formed between two locations on two cells.
   These locations need to be declared on the :ref:`cell <modelcells>`.
2. Gap Junction instantiation in the :ref:`recipe <modelrecipe>`: The **gap junction sites** are indexed using :cpp:type:`cell_member`,
   which identifies a specific instance (:cpp:type:`cell_member::index`) on a specific cell (:cpp:type:`cell_member::gid`). A gap junction is
   instantiated by providing 2 **gap junction sites'** :cpp:type:`cell_member`, as well as a conductance in Î¼S.
   In the recipe, each cell has access to all of the gap junctions where at least one :cpp:type:`cell_member::gid` refers to that cell.

Arbor has Gap Junctions implemented only for cable cells as of now.
